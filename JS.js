//List of things needed for the quiz to work:

// 1. Create a main page where the quiz can begin
// 2. Create a header or footer where the score will be tracked
// 3. Create a button that begins the quiz
// 4. Program a timer that runs across the header or footer of each page
// 5. Program a method for the timer to begin congruently with the beginning of the quiz
// 6. Program a means by which the amount of time remaining in the quiz will be reduced with each missed question



// 7. Program a leaderboard that saves user's scores and initials
        //-Find out if you can use a prompt to assign a value to a variable and then to use a second prompt to assign that variable sub-strings

        var player = {
            Initials: prompt("Please enter your initials"),
            PlayerScore: ("Placeholder"),
