//List of things needed for the quiz to work:

// 1. Create a main page where the quiz can begin
        //page should be easily over-writable, with each new question overwriting each previous "body" of the page
// 2. Create a header or footer where the score will be tracked
    // Header seems like it'll work better, but might not even be necessary. Just an h1 or h2, with everything else being overwritten likely would work
// 3. Create a button that begins the quiz
// 4. Program a timer that runs across the header or footer of each page
// 5. Program a method for the timer to begin congruently with the beginning of the quiz
// 6. Program a means by which the amount of time remaining in the quiz will be reduced with each missed question
// 7. Program a leaderboard that saves user's scores and initials
        //-Find out if you can use a prompt to assign a value to a variable and then to use a second prompt to assign that variable sub-strings
