# CodingQuiz
This is a programmed quiz to test a user's working knowledge of Javascript, while also testing my own abilities with Javascript programming.

I attempted to use javascript overwrites to repeatedly re-write the main page with new and different information. Starting with the main page, new questions with buttons for answers were repeatedly overwritten and then removed as needed. 

At the end of the quiz, the user was able to submit a high score to a high score page that would save the scores to the local storage.

The github repository can be found at:

Special thanks to Christian M. and JP Nederveld for helping me out with my JSON in our study group.
